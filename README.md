# DSA4266_Group1: Phishing Email Detection Project

This project aims to address the rising threat of phishing emails. Our goal is to develop a machine learning (ML) system capable of processing and analyzing email text to accurately detect phishing attempts.

## Repository Structure
This repository has a folder titled `Archive`, which stores the old code for data preprocessing and the different models. `Group_1_Models.ipynb` contains the updated code for all the models compiled into a single filo.

## Getting Started

To use the project files:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chiralcentre/DSA4266_Group1
   ```

2. Download the dataset from Zenodo, which includes the following files:
   - `Nazario_5.csv`
   - `Nigerian_Fraud.csv`
   - `TREC_05.csv`
   - `TREC_06.csv`
   - `TREC_07.csv`
   - `Nazario.csv`
   - `SpamAssasin.csv`
   - `CEAS_08.csv`
   - `Nigerian_5.csv`

   Create a `data` folder, and ensure all CSV files are placed in the `data` folder before running the code.

3. Run the code in `Group_1_Models.ipynb` in sequential order to observe the models in action. Note that if you are running the code for the first time, the code in the `Import Library and Dataset` section is to be uncommented so that all libraries can be imported. 

## Data Sources
