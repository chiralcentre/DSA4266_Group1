# DSA4266_Group1: Phishing Email Detection Project

This project aims to address the rising threat of phishing emails. Our objective is to develop a machine learning (ML) system that processes and analyzes email text to accurately detect phishing attempts.

## Repository Structure

- `Archive/` - Contains deprecated code for data preprocessing and previous model iterations.
- `Group_1_Models.ipynb` - The main notebook with updated code for all models compiled into a single file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chiralcentre/DSA4266_Group1
   ```

2. **Download the dataset** from Zenodo and place the files in the appropriate directories:

   **Place these files into the `data/` folder**:
   - `Nazario_5.csv`
   - `Nigerian_Fraud.csv`
   - `TREC_05.csv`
   - `TREC_06.csv`
   - `TREC_07.csv`
   - `Nazario.csv`
   - `SpamAssasin.csv`
   - `CEAS_08.csv`

   **Place this file into the `test/` folder**:
   - `Nigerian_5.csv`

3. **Run the models**:
   Execute the code in `Group_1_Models.ipynb` in sequential order to observe the model training and results.

## Data Sources
