# DSA4266_Group1: Phishing Email Detection Project

This project aims to address the rising threat of phishing emails. Our goal is to develop a machine learning (ML) system capable of processing and analyzing email text to accurately detect phishing attempts.

## Getting Started

To use the project files:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chiralcentre/DSA4266_Group1
   ```

2. Download the dataset from Zenodo, which includes the following files:
   - `Nazario_5.csv`
   - `Nigerian_Fraud.csv`
   - `TREC_05.csv`
   - `TREC_06.csv`
   - `TREC_07.csv`
   - `Nazario.csv`
   - `SpamAssasin.csv`
   - `CEAS_08.csv`
   - `Nigerian_5.csv`

   Ensure all CSV files are placed in the `data` directory before running the code.

3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to run the code and start detecting phishing emails.
